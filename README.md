# classification_NN
This project uses the Tensorflow framework to create a Neural Network program that classifies the clothing article given an image.ar
The model uses a standard training data and testing data to calculate its training and testing accuracy.
The training accuracy was 91% and testing accuracy 87% which does show some overfitting by the model. 
If you take a look at the image classification performace its predictive performance is very good.

The clothing categories are placed in an array, here is what each index represents:
0: 'T-shirt/top',
1: 'Trouser', 
2: 'Pullover', 
3: 'Dress', 
4: 'Coat',
5: 'Sandal', 
6: 'Shirt', 
7: 'Sneaker', 
8: 'Bag', 
9: 'Ankle boot'
